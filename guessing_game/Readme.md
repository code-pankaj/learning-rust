| Cargo Project & Dependencies   | Cargo is Rust's package manager and build system. It was used to create the project (`cargo new`) and manage external code by adding crates like `rand` (for random numbers) and `colored` (for text color) to the `Cargo.toml` file. | [00:37], [04:35], [11:48]   |
| Variable Declaration (`let`)   | The `let` keyword is used to declare variables, such as `guess` and `secret_number`.                                                                                                            | [01:24], [05:12]            |
| Immutability and Mutability (`mut`) | By default, all variables in Rust are immutable. The `mut` keyword was used to make the `guess` variable mutable so its value could be changed (by storing the user's input).                                                | [02:15], [02:22]            |
| Data Types (`String`, `u32`)   | The program uses the standard library `String` type for the user's input. Later, the variable is converted to an unsigned 32-bit integer (`u32`) for comparison with the secret number.        | [01:38], [07:54]            |
| Bringing into Scope (`use`)    | The `use` keyword is necessary to bring external modules and items, like the standard Input/Output library (`std::io`) and the `Rng` trait, into the program's scope so they can be easily accessed. | [02:34], [06:03], [12:15]   |
| Input/Output (`std::io::stdin`) | The `std::io` library and `stdin()` function are used to read the user's input from the terminal and store it in the `guess` variable using `read_line`.                                      | [02:50]                     |
| References                     | The `read_line` function requires a mutable reference (`&mut guess`) to the string buffer, which allows it to modify the string without taking ownership of the variable.                      | [03:03]                     |
| Error Handling (`Result` & `expect`) | Functions like `read_line` and `parse` return a `Result` enumeration, which forces the programmer to handle two possible outcomes: `Ok` (success) or `Err` (failure). The `expect` method was initially used to handle the error by crashing the program (`panic!`) with a custom message. | [03:15], [03:40]            |
| Control Flow (`loop` and `break`) | The `loop` keyword creates an infinite loop, allowing the user to make multiple guesses. The `break` keyword is used within the loop to exit the program when the user guesses correctly. | [08:54], [10:01]            |
| Pattern Matching (`match`)     | The `match` expression is used to compare the user's guess to the secret number based on the `Ordering` enum (`Less`, `Greater`, `Equal`). It is also used later to gracefully handle invalid numerical input instead of panicking. | [06:44], [10:41]            |
| Type Conversion (`trim`, `parse`) | String methods like `trim` (to remove whitespace) and `parse` (to convert the string into a numerical type) are used to prepare the user's text input for comparison.                      | [07:31], [07:38]            |
| Shadowing                      | The initial `guess` variable (a `String`) was shadowed by a new `guess` variable (a `u32` integer) to convert its type while preserving the convenient variable name.                           | [11:13]                     |
